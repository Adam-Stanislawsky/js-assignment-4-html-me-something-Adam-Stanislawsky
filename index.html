      <h1>Blenko Collector Beginners Guide</h1>
      <p>Blenko Glass Company has been a family owned and operated company since 1893. They have been located in Milton, WV since 1921. Exquisite color, skilled craftsmen, and imaginative designs have made Blenko famous in the time-honored craft of hand-blown glass.</p>
      <p>Why I collect:
         <ul>
            <li>Timeless design</li>
            <li>Valuable</li>
            <li>Easy/cheap to collect (if you know what to look for)</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
      <p>I believe it would be nice to have a simple guide for identifying Blenko pieces, as well as determining the color, model number, and year they may have been produced</p>
