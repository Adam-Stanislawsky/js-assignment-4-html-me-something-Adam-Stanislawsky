         <p>Blenko Glass Company has been a family owned and operated company since 1893. They have been located in Milton, WV since 1921. Exquisite color, skilled craftsmen, and imaginative designs have made Blenko famous in the time-honored craft of hand-blown glass.</p>
         <p>Why I collect:
            <ul>
               <li>Timeless design</li>
               <li>Valuable</li>
               <li>Easy/cheap to collect (if you know what to look for)</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>I believe it would be nice to have a simple guide for identifying Blenko pieces, as well as determining the color, model number, and year they may have been produced</p>

         <p>My current rough method to identify a Blenko piece:
            <ul>
               <li>Check for pontil mark (not ALWAYS present)</li>
               <li>Determine if it is a Blenko color</li>
               <li>Browse through blenko catalogs to find possible match</li>
               <li>Search ebay sold listings by model number and color to determine value</li>
            </ul>

         <p>Blenko designers (not all, but created most sought after designs):
            <ul>
               <li>Winslow Anderson (1947-1953)</li>
               <li>Wayne Husted (my favorite)(1952-1963)</li>
               <li>Joel Myers(1963-1970)</li>
               <li>Hank Murta Adams (my second favorite) (1988-1994)</li>
               </ul>
         </p>
