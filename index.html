         <p>Blenko Glass Company has been a family owned and operated company since 1893. They have been located in Milton, WV since 1921. Exquisite color, skilled craftsmen, and imaginative designs have made Blenko famous in the time-honored craft of hand-blown glass.</p>
         <p>Why I collect:
            <ul>
               <li>Timeless design</li>
               <li>Valuable</li>
               <li>Easy/cheap to collect (if you know what to look for)</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>I believe it would be nice to have a simple guide for identifying Blenko pieces, as well as determining the color, model number, and year they may have been produced</p>
